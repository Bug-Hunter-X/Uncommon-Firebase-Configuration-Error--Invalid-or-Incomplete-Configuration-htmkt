The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided configuration object is invalid or incomplete. This is a common error, but it can be difficult to track down if the configuration is spread across multiple files or environment variables.  A specific error might be `FirebaseError: [code: auth/invalid-credential]` or something similar, depending on the faulty part of your configuration.
