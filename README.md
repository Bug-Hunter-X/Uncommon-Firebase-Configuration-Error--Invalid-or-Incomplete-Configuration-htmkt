# Uncommon Firebase Configuration Error: Invalid or Incomplete Configuration
This repository demonstrates a common yet often tricky Firebase error: authentication failures stemming from incomplete or incorrect configuration data.  The error may manifest subtly and is harder to catch than simple syntax problems.

The `firebase-config-error.js` file shows an example of problematic configuration, and `firebase-config-solution.js` provides a corrected version.

The problem arises when the configuration object passed to Firebase is missing crucial elements, such as the `apiKey`, `authDomain`, or `projectId` (or if those are incorrect).  This can prevent Firebase from properly initializing and connecting to your project, resulting in authentication and other API errors.
